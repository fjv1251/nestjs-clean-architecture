## Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Organize your codebase in a way that separates concerns, making it easier to manage and test.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on the core business logic, ensuring that your application is aligned with business needs.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Use MongoDB for your database needs, providing flexibility and scalability.
- **Docker Support**: Easily deploy your application in containers for consistent environments.
- **Monitoring with Prometheus**: Collect metrics and monitor your application performance.
- **Visualize with Grafana**: Create dashboards to visualize metrics collected from your application.
- **Swagger API Documentation**: Automatically generate and maintain API documentation.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Prometheus**: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Grafana**: An open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fjv1251/nestjs-clean-architecture.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nestjs-clean-architecture
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables. You can create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with the required configuration.

### Running the Application

To run the application, you can use Docker Compose. This will start both the application and the MongoDB database.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

```

## API Documentation

This project uses Swagger to generate API documentation. Once the application is running, you can access the documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Monitoring and Metrics

To monitor your application, we use Prometheus and Grafana. Hereâ€™s how to set them up:

1. **Prometheus**: Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application. You can find the configuration in the `prometheus.yml` file.
2. **Grafana**: After setting up Prometheus, you can create dashboards in Grafana to visualize your application metrics.
